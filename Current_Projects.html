    <h3>Identification of stress levels using the fNIRS with comparison to cortisol levels and electrocardiogram
    </h3>
    <p>
      Acknowledging that modern day technology provides people with various objective measurements related to their physical health instantly (e.g. the daily health checking program in smartwatches), our team aspired to find a way to obtain such measurements for psychological well-being. One familiar index would be stress. There exist several methods in measuring stress levels, including using questionnaires or observing individualsâ€™ cortisol levels. Yet such methods have their disadvantages: questionnaires are inherently subjective and may show biased results due to confounding factors, and observing cortisol levels lack convenience. Regarding such limitations, our team hypothesized that the fNIRS may be a solution to acquire efficient and reliable stress level measurements once it has been validated.
 
      To this end, our team designed an experiment to test whether the fNIRS is able to measure stress levels to a reliable degree, and compare the acquired fNIRS data to established methods such as questionnaire results, cortisol levels, and electrocardiogram data.
